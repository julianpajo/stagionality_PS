**Title:**
Orchestration of a Docker Swarm for Monitoring and Seasonal Analysis of Persistent Scatterers Displacement

This project represents a study on how to define and orchestrate services for monitoring soil displacement using Persistent Scatterers and conducting a seasonal analysis of them.

Persistent Scatterers are stable radar reflectors on the ground that consistently return strong radar signals over time. They are used in satellite radar interferometry to monitor and measure very slight movements of the Earth's surface, which can be crucial for detecting and understanding ground subsidence, infrastructure stability, and other geological phenomena.

**Setting Up the System:**
To set up the system, follow the subsequent tutorial [here](./deployment/swarm/README.md)
